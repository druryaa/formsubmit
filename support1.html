                <h2> WHAT IS CHILD SUPPORT AND WHEN IS IT PAID?</h2>

                   <h3> When addressing child support issues, the starting point is the determination of the parenting schedule. Once the schedule has been determined, the child support is a relatively straight forward issue. </h3>
                    
                    <p>However, there can be disagreement over whether the child is still a dependant and therefore entitled to child support. Another contentious issues can be the contributions to a child's expenses. </p>
                    
                        <p>It is important to remember that child support is the 'right of the child' and typically cannot be negotiated away by one parent. As a consequence, child support recipients can seek an adjustment of support on a retroactive basis.   </p>
                    
                            <p>We aim to try and resolve issues of child support without Court intervention. It is always better to try and resolve the issue of support, rather than seeking a Court order. However, there are litigants who refuse to pay child support, and in these cases, it is imperative that you protect your interests. </p>
                    
                                <p>Child support is governed by two sets of 'Guidelines'. Federal Child Support Guidelines is used to calculate child support for married couples. Common law couples are governed by the Provincial Child Support Guidelines. The federal and provincial guidelines are very similar. </p>
                    
                                    <p>The type of parenting arrangement between the parties will determine how to use the Child Support Guidelines. Parents that are engaged in a parenting arrangement that has one parent assuming primary care of the children, which typically means, one parent has the children in their care for about 60% of the time or more, will simply look up the payor parent's income within the Guidelines to determine how much monthly support to pay.  </p>
                    
                                        <p>In the event that parents 'share care' of the children, which means each parent has the children in their care for about 50% of the time, the Guidelines presume a sharing of expenses. As a result, the child support calculated under the Guidelines is a little more complicated. When parents have almost equal time with the children, they can calculate their support based on a 'set-off' amount. Under a shared parenting arrangement, both parties calculate what their table amount of support would be each month. The party with the higher amount of support pays to the other spouse an offset amount of what they would pay less the recipient spouse’s obligation under the guidelines. </p>
                    
                                            <p>It is calculated as follows:</p>
                    
                                                <p>Mike’s income is $60,000.00 per year.</p>
                    
                                                    <p>Sally’s income is $90,000.00 per year.</p>
                    
                                                        <p>The parties have three children, Kurt, Bryce and Jarrod that rotate between each parties’ household on a week-on-week-off basis. This type of parenting arrangement means that each parent has the children in their care for one week, then transition to the other parent for a week. In this scenario Mike’s monthly child support obligation under the Guidelines would be $1,192.00 per month, and Sally’s obligation would be $1,764.00. Therefore, Sally would pay to Mike her support payment less Mike's periodic payment, which results in the set-off amount of $572.00.</p>
                    
                    <h3>IS A CHILD STILL A DEPENDANT?</h3>
                    
                    <p>One contentious issue that can arise in a child support dispute, is the issue of entitlement. If a child is no longer a dependant, pursuant to the Family Law Act or the Divorce Act, then child support is not payable. </p>
                    
                        <p>Some payor parents may try and claim a child is no longer a dependant and refuse to pay support. We represented a mother that was challenged by the payor of child support, to terminate his obligations to pay support for a disabled child. The matter, Bueckert v. Sutherland 2020 ONSC 815, went to trial and our client was successful in having her child support continue for her 24-year-old daughter. In addition, our client was awarded her legal fees following the trial. </p>
